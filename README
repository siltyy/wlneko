                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{x,w,o}neko, blindly ported to wayland for wlroots-based compositors. definitely
tested on compositors other than sway :)

wlneko was brought into existence to prove that it could be; don't expect any
fancy features and be thankful the compositor doesn't need to get restarted to
re-skin the cat. patches, praise, and hatemail all welcome.

"but how can this exist, o wise one? is wayland not the work of the demiurge and
whatnot in that it disallows clients from fetching global pointer coordinates
among other things?" thankfully, wayland's security is no match for linux's
distinct lack thereof, and cursor movements can be directly intercepted through
ld preload hooking. if you're a compositor dev, hi ^-^ and also please don't
start statically linking wlroots. this will still be possible, just really
annoying.


Building
--------

the nightly toolchain is required.

	$ cargo rustc --release -- --emit link=wlneko.so


Usage
-----

it seems like `LD_PRELOAD` doesn't have any effect on sway, so the preloading
will need to be done manually with `ld-linux.so`. this is preferable anyways,
since it avoids the variable potentially propegating.

	$ /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so* --preload /absolute/path/to/wlneko.so \
	/usr/bin/sway [sway options]


there are extra skins that are not shipped with wlneko for licensing reasons. a
script is included to download them in bulk. note that this requires `curl` and
will make a series of https requests to neocities.org. to run (very difficult!):

	$ ./download_spritesheets.sh


wlneko will attempt to read its skin from `<working dir>/neko.png`. if this file
is updated, so too is the sprite. if at any point this process should fail,
wlneko will fall back to an embedded skin.


Todo
----

- span across multiple monitors instead of doing whatever it does right now
- fix bugs


Bugs
----

under certain conditions, the sprite will change its visual direction long
before actually moving in that direction. this is probably a simple fix.
